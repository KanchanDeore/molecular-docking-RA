# ðŸ§ª Molecular Docking: Identifying Potential Drug Candidates for Rheumatoid Arthritis

This project explores how **bioinformatics tools** can be used to identify potential therapeutic compounds for **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)** using **molecular docking** techniques. The goal is to simulate and evaluate how small molecules (ligands) bind to target proteins involved in RA â€” helping in the early phases of drug discovery.

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the joints, causing inflammation and damage. Drug discovery for RA requires understanding how molecules interact with biological targets.

This project involves:

1. **Target Selection**  
   - Key RA-related protein: *Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-Î±)*  
   - Retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)

2. **Ligand Preparation**  
   - Natural anti-inflammatory compounds identified via literature  
   - Structures downloaded from PubChem and optimized

3. **Docking Process**  
   - Tools used: **AutoDock**, **AutoDock Vina**, and **PyMOL**  
   - Proteins cleaned and grids generated  
   - Ligands docked to evaluate binding affinity

4. **Analysis**  
   - Top ligands ranked by binding energy  
   - Interaction visualized via 3D binding pocket models
